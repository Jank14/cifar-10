# Random Hyperparameter Search in Tensorflow

The cifar-10 dataset is used to implement random hyperparameter search in Tensorflow.

### Hyperparameter Search
cifar-10.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook, which implements the search

cifar-10-Round3.ipynb is an extension of cifar-10.ipynb for the 3rd round of searching.

### Analysis
Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook, which analyses results obtained.

### Data
The cifar-10 dataset required is available from <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>
